//     the view the graph was launched from or the one it later opened itself.
//     Explicit, so it wins.
//   - failing that, the only linear view in the session showing this assembly.
//     The pangenome sessions this view ships in are a linear view above a graph
//     with no pairing recorded, and there "the linear view" is unambiguous — the
//     same reasoning hoverSync's isConnected already applies to highlights.
//   - two or more candidates and no pairing: nothing. Guessing which of the
//     user's views to scroll is worse than opening one that is ours to move.
//
// Assembly-gated throughout: a linear view on a different assembly cannot show
// this location at all.
